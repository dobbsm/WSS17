### Statement of the Problem

Create the rule-space of 12-scale notes with n neighbouring notes and observe the patterns and distributions created after a number of iterations on the space of initializations.

Additionally, create a list of enumerated primitives that act on musical notes and observe the structure and patterns that emerge when they are applied continuously. This list will cover elementary actions such as inversion, retrograde, dimunition, and scale shifting. Furthermore, these rules will be applied randomly to create a musical composition.

### Outline of the Solution

The note rule-space was fabricated and enumerated for n neighbouring notes. A histogram of time spent on a note throughout the iteration was created for arbitrary rules in the space. The 12-note rule-space converges to a cyclic group of maximum length 12 in a maximum number of time-steps of 12.

Additionally, a list of the primitives described in the "Goal" section was created and random compositions were made. Some variables implemented include the number of notes, tempo, type of instrument(s), and relative volume between the instruments.  While the algorithmic composer exhibits musical structure, it is not guaranteed to be aesthetically pleasing.

### Topic Exploration: Fourier Series

The Fourier Series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of sinusoids.
